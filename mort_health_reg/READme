  The notebook above covers mortality rates in the US against individual states spending on education and other health services. The focus in on 
differences of regressors between each state and thru the years 1993 to 2015, but also for 3 different age groups: 0-18, 18-19-64, 64+. Some of the
regressors include: median income, education spending, taxes and so on. The relationship between each regressor is tested on each other (for 
multicollinearity) and on mortality statistics such as life expectancy,  # of deaths, and probability of death. Also mentioned in the Notebook, 
the increased number of files uploaded is due to each individual expenditure and education statistics per year. **Interpretations in notebook 
coming soon**
