  The Jupyter Notebook conducts a Regression Analysis of CO2 Emissions on several factors including: coal prices, electricity prices, petroleum 
prices, natural gas prices, total population, state GDP, and gdp per capita of each state. The main idea is to also highlight the significance of 
Year and State Fixed effects, which I included 3 separate regressions for. Keep in mind: in the Jupyter Notebook, however, the final descriptions 
of the results (The "INTERPRETATIONS" sections) Only covers the State Fixed Effects, and not the Year.
